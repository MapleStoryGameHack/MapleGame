# MapleGame
MapleStory server emualtor written in C#, currently on V1.11

Features list:

Characters (movements, attacks, skills, inventory and so on)  
Mobs (everything)   
NPCs (everything, codable)  
Reactors (only the ones that breaks with normal attacks, I have no idea how the others work)

Cash Shop (packeges, cash inventory, wish list, basically everything besides gifts)   
Supports multi-worlds, each channel can be hosted on a different machine  
Some source tools as the packet recorder  
Player and admin commands 


Some notes: 
As for the NPCs, quests and portals, nothing is coded actually, each one have only one example  
I didn't code any skills/buffs since v0.75, because in later versions they're completely changed   
Some of the features I coded on previous versions of the game, so they're working but the packets aren't updated (such as buffs)  
There is a new bug with equiping cash items, haven't touched it yet
